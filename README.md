# Mistral Trail System

### Introduction
* Mistral Trail System is a substitute for Unity’s built-in Trail Renderer Component. 

### Features
* Supports Smooth Trail. Unity’s built-in Trail Renderer has very sharp transitions on corners. Mistral Trail System fixes this. 
* Supports B-Spline Interpolation. Users can simply assign discrete control points and a trail path will be generated automatically. 
* Supports Editor Preview. Users don’t have to enter the play mode to have a look at how the trail will be working.
